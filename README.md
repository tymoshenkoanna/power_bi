# An example of the project portfolio dashboard created in the Power BI
Source: furniture_projects.xlsx 

(furniture_projects.csv saved as an alternative source. I prefer working with an excel as the data is already cleaned up in the excel files). 

Actual Power BI dashboard: furniture_projects.pbix

Saved overviews in .jpg and .pdf: furniture_projects.jpg and furniture_projects.pdf


This is an example used to demonstrate an ability to create a simple yet comprehensive Power BI dashboard for portfolio overview

Excel was used as source for convenience. Same Dashboard can easily be created using SharePoint lists
