An example of the project portfolio dashboard created in the Power BI
< br/>Source: furniture_projects.xlsx (furniture_projects.csv saved as an alternative source. I prefer working with an excel as the data is alreadz cleaned up in the excel files). 
< br/>Actual Power BI dashboard: furniture_projects.pbix
< br/>Saved overviews in .jpg and .pdf: furniture_projects.jpg and furniture_projects.pdf

This is an example used to demonstrate an ability to create a simple yet comprehancive Power BI dashboard for portfolio overview
Excel was used as source for convenience. Same Dashboard can easily be created using SharePoint lists
